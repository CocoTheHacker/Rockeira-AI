## What is this?
[Rockeira](https://goo.gl/jdEoHo) is a [bot for Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) using machine learning ([ChatterBot](http://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) to learn how to interact with the user.

## Disclaimer
### Data collect
If you want to add [Rockeira](https://goo.gl/jdEoHo) to your server remember that it is still in the learning phase and needs data, once inserted in your server it will be taking the conversations (only new conversations after inserted to your server) for educational purposes. If this bothers you, feel free to make your version.
